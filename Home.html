       <h1>How Flowering Plants Changed the World</h1>
       
        <p><em>"If we have an accurate picture of the evolution of a flowering plant," says 
            Walter Judd, "then we can know things about its structure and function that
            will help us answer certain questions: What sorts of species can it be crossed
            with? What sorts of pollinators are effective?" This, he says, takes us toward
            ever more sensible and productive methods of agriculture, as well as a clearer
            understanding of the larger process of evolution.
