       <h1>How Flowering Plants Changed the World</h1>
       
        <p><em>"If we have an accurate picture of the evolution of a flowering plant," says 
            Walter Judd, "then we can know things about its structure and function that
            will help us answer certain questions: What sorts of species can it be crossed
            with? What sorts of pollinators are effective?" This, he says, takes us toward
            ever more sensible and productive methods of agriculture, as well as a clearer
            understanding of the larger process of evolution.

            salads and soups.</em>
        </p>


        <br><h3>Allium</h3>
        <p> <div id="img-p4"><img width=" 250" src="images/type 5.jpg"/></div>

            heads. Blooms are typically violet, but blue and pink varieties can also be found.</em>

            flower. Dahlias can be difficult to grow, requiring well-drained soil and full sun, but the
            payoff is great with a colorful garden ranging in hues from red to violet to pink.</em>
